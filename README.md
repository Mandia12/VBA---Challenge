# VBA---Challenge

Purpose:

This project calculates and presents valuable information from data sets that represent stock values over a year's time for the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. 

Most of the code was written by myself with the help of previous exercises done in class. However, I derived some code from stackoverflow.com like the For loop that cycles through all the worksheets.
